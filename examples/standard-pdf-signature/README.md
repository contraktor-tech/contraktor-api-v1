# Contraktor API Example: Standard PDF Signature

This example demonstrates how to use Contraktor API v1 to
upload a file, use it to create a contract and send it for
signature.

## How to run the example

You need to have `node` version 8.2 or higher installed and
a Contraktor Api Key generated for you. With that in hand,
execute the following:

```
npm install
export API_KEY="xxx"
node index
```

That's it! A contract should be created on Contraktor and the signature
process started.
